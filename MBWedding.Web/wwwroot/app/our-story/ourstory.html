                <b>The Story</b>
                <br />Brittney and Matthew had their first date on Wednesday June 4th, 2014 at Roswell Tap in Roswell Georgia. Every Wednesday at Roswell Tap is trivia night,
                and that night they played (poorly) and had a wonderful time with each other.
                They first found each other online a few weeks prior to that magical night, and after
                messaging online, they decided to meet in person!

                Fast forward a few weeks to July 4th weekend where Brittney and Matt went to a Friday night Braves game with
                a special Fireworks display after the game. Brittney also invited Matt to go up to one of her child hood friend's lake house the following day. They had a wonderful time together
                celebrating America's birthday, and it wasn't very long after that they decided to start dating make their relationship "Facebook official."

                A few more months' forward from July 4th, and Brittney and Matt spent their first Thanksgiving together as a couple. That thanksgiving was really special, because not only
                was it their first thanksgiving together, it was also "dogsgiving". Brittney's parents were out of town that weekend, and Brittney and Matt had Kodi and Gracie with them
                at Matt's parent's house. Kodi and Gracie got to meet Ottis and Rufus! They all got along wonderfully and had a blast playing with each other.

                Fast forward almost 6 months to May of 2015, and Brittney surprised Matt with a new puppy for his birthday. They had been talking about adopting another puppy as a friend for the older
                <img src="/app/assets/img/jaxlouie.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" style="max-height: 150px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px" />
                beagle, Jax, for quite some time. They drove out to Marietta, Georgia to potentially meet their new puppy, who at the time was named Hart. After meeting Hart, Matt fell in love with
                him and knew he would a perfect friend for Jax. At the time however, Hart was still too young to take home, so Brittney and Matt had to wait another 3 weeks until he was 8 weeks old.
                During this waiting time, they struggled with many different potential names for their new puppy, but finally landed on Louie. After finally taking Louie home, he and Jax have been best
                buds!

                <b>The Engagement!</b>
                <br />Brittney had told Matt that he had to wait at least a year before proposing, so Matt waited a year and month.
                By the time Matt proposed to Brittney, he had known for quite some time that he wanted to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her.
                Once he decided to propose in summer of 2015, Matt spent a few weeks thinking about how to ask <i>the</i> big question. Matt finally decided to
                do something at the GA Aquarium as it was a special place for the two of them. About a month into their relationship, Brittney surprised Matt with
                a evening adventure to the Aquarium.
            </p>
            <p>
                After deciding to propose at the Aquarium, Matt then contacted the Aquarium and set up a special behind the scenes tour where he would pop the question at the end.
                A few weeks prior to the night, he told Brittney that he had bought a Groupon for a behind the scenes tour at the Aquarium and that they had to use it sometime during July.
                He put "Aquarium Date Night?" on their calendar for a few Fridays in July, even though he knew the 17th was the real day. A few days prior to July 17th, Matt told Brittney they
                should use their "Groupon" that Friday night. Matt told Brittney they should go to a fancy restaurant, and that he might even tuck in his shirt!

                Upon arriving at the Aquarium that night, they explored the exhibits themselves for a little while before their tour started. Upon arriving at the tour desk, they were informed
                that no one else was coming on the tour with them. Brittney guessed that no one else was using their "Groupon" that night and that they were luckily that got a personal tour instead of
                a large group tour. After seeing the top side of the Ocean Voyager tank and some of the other employee only sections of the Aquarium, they were taken to the top of the Tropical tank
                where an exhibit of clams and other coral life was on display.
                <img src="/app/assets/img/slide1.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" style="max-height: 150px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px" />They were told they could not touch the live clams and coral, but they could touch and see some of the fossils next to
                live exhibit. Brittney was hesitant at first to touch them, and Matt opened some of the smaller ones. After encouraging Brittney to touch and feel them, she opened the biggest clam
                which had a fake pearl and the inscription "Will You Marry Me" on the inside of it. At that point, Matt got down on one knee and asked the big question!

                After they were happily engaged, Matt had one more surprise up his sleeve, and the happy couple then met both of their parents at Maggiano's for a post engagement
                dinner party. They are happily engaged and enjoying engagement before starting serious wedding planning sometime in the coming months. Stay tuned for more information
                about their wedding!
